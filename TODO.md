1. cask "using auto-updates"
	* Understand what cask output like `A Cask for vlc is already installed and using auto-updates.` means. I image auto-updates is not in the context of homebrew, but instead refers to within the context of that specific app or is it a universally concept? Contrast with "A Cask for omnioutliner is already installed"
